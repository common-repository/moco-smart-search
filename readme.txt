== Description ==
The importance of a fast and well integrated information retrieval system cannot be underestimated. Users expect to have a site search that operates like Google. They need it to quickly sort through your products and produce relevant results quickly. Plus, they expect to be able to drill down through your product listings as quickly as possible, just like the larger eCommerce sites allow them to do. Smart Search allows your visitors to do exactly that.

The Morrison Consulting Smart Search plugin incorporates a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library, optimized to provide the best speed and accuracy for the WordPress platform. Smart Search technology uses the best in class relevance and ranking algorithm to display your search results in an order that makes sense.

With our Smart Search technology you can:

Match word stems and plurals. For example: running matches run, shelves matches shelf.
Custom spell check built by your own product database allowing you to suggest recommendations, such as "Did you mean: Morrison Consulting (instead of Morisson Consult)."
Dynamic Sorting on Relevance, Price, Highest Rated, Best Sellers.
